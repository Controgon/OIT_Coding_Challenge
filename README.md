# OIT_Coding_Challenge
It took me a full 30 minutes to completely understand all of the rules and where one rule could take care of itself through a certain logic. I started with a basic strategy of splitting the roman numerals into pairs based on the subtraction that would need to be done. I then made a main function to get the most overarching structure over with and then moved on to the roman numeral converter. I split it into smaller chunks as I saw that my paragraph of code was becoming hard to read after I was almost done. Once I got my test roman numeral to work, I only had an hour and a half to complete the other half of the challenge. I started with the easier cases, if the number was directly in the dictionary and then if it was only one off.
I eventually ran into an infinite loop trying to see how many additions of base tens were needed to equal the desired number. It was definitely an interesting challange and I may need to complete it at another time.
I took the full time to code using python on VScode.
